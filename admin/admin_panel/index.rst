GeoNode provides by default some theming options manageable directly from the Administration panel. 
Most of the times those options allows you to easily change the GeoNode look and feel without touching a single line of `HTML` or `CSS`.

As an `administrator` go to ``http://<your_geonode_host>/admin/geonode_themes/geonodethemecustomization/``.

    *List of available Themes*

The panel shows all the available GeoNode themes, if any, and allows you to create new ones.

.. warning:: Only one theme at a time can be **activated** (aka *enabled*). By disabling or deleting all the available themes, GeoNode will turn the gui back to the default one.

Editing or creating a new Theme, will actually allow you to customize several properties.

At least you'll need to provide a ``Name`` for the Theme. Optionally you can specify also a ``Description``, which will allow you to better
identify the type of Theme you created.

    *Theme Name and Description*

Just below the ``Description`` field, you will find the ``Enabled`` checkbox, allowing you to toggle the Theme.

Jumbotron and Get Started link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: Remember, everytime you want to apply some changes to the Theme, you **must** save the Theme and reload the GeoNode browser tab.

The next section, allows you to define the first important Theme properties. This part involves the GeoNode main page sections.
