Quick Installation Guide
========================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is a quick guide to get started with GeoNode in most common operating systems.

.. note:: For a full setup and deployment, please refer to the :doc:`complete installation guides </install/index>`

This is meant to be run on a fresh machine with no previously installed packages or GeoNode versions.

.. warning:: The methods presented here are meant to be used for a limited internal demo only.
    Before exposing your GeoNode instance to a public server, please read carefully the :doc:`hardening guide </advanced/hardening/index>`

Recommended Minimum System Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For deployment of GeoNode on a single server, the following are the *bare minimum* system requirements:

* 8GB of RAM.
* 2.2GHz processor with 2 cores. (Additional processing power may be required for multiple concurrent styling renderings)
* 10 GB software disk usage.
* Additional disk space for any data hosted with GeoNode and tiles cached with GeoWebCache.
  For spatial data, cached tiles, and "scratch space" useful for administration, a decent baseline size for GeoNode deployments is between 50GB and 100GB.
* 64-bit hardware **strongly** recommended.
